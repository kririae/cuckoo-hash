Cuckoo Hash
===========

This repository is some code and experiments on Cuckoo Hash, specifically,
It is an implementation for *Real-Time Parallel Hashing on the GPU*. 
NVIDIA's CUB and Thrust are used for optimization.

To use this repo, run `make all`. Two executable files will be produced, 
`hash` and `tests`. You can collect data and validate correctness using them.
